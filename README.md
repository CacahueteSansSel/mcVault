<h3 align="center">mcVault</h3>

<p align="center">Self hostable, drop-in replacement for Mojang's Minecraft resources delivery server, in case <b>the lights does go dark definitively</b></p>

In other words, **mcVault** will let you host your own server to download Minecraft resources in order to launch the game, without communicating with Mojang servers.

You will be able to download official versions from official Mojang servers and backup them on disk, and download them on-demand on your other computer on the network.

> This project is closely tied to [mcLaunch](https://github.com/CacahueteSansSel/mcLaunch).
